FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS TO RUN YOUR JAVASCRIPT APPLICATION USING SUBLIME TEXT 2 (FOR WINDOWS USERS ONLY).

STEP 1 :
Open your sublime text 2 and write the following command-

{
	"cmd" : ["C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe","$file"],
	"selector": "source.js"
}
Note:- Here    C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe     is my path where node exists. This is default path, if you have changed it then keep that path in place of this.

STEP 2:
Save this file as "JavaScript.sublime-build" (without quotes) and save it in the folder  "Sublime-text/packages/User". 

Note:- Saving the written code in 1st step works like this
             "x.sublime-build" (without quotes), Here 'x' can be any langauge. Like we are focusing on JavaScript then x is replaced by JavaScript, User can replace it with PHP if               one wants to code in PHP, etc.

STEP 3:
Open a new Tab (using Ctrl+n) and write a small script like this-
	var title = "Hello World!";
	console.log(title);

Step 4:
Now to check whether it is running properly or not, Goto Tools->Build.
By default it will run the program. In case, if program will not run then go for Tools->Build System->JavaScript.
Your Script will run and print the message "Hello World!" (without quotes).
